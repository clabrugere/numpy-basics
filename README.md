# Numpy basics

## Context
This is a small project to recall machine learning basics. It consists in implementing a few fundamental algorithms in numpy. While some care was taken into the implementation, these are not optimized.

## Project structure
A few classical algorithms are implemented:
* Linear regression (L2 regularization)
* Logistic regression (L2 regularization)
* K-NN regressor and classifier (Euclidean distance)
* Decision tree classifier (entropy for splits)
* Random forest classifier (entropy for splits)

## Getting Started

Just clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/clabrugere/numpy-basics.git
```

### Requirements

* python 3.7
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn
